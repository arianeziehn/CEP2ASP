# Bridging the Gap: Complex Event Processing on Stream Processing Engines

This repository provides a query catalog of Complex Event Processing (CEP) patterns, and their respective Analytical Stream Processing (ASP) queries, translated using our theoretical operator mapping approach. 
The provided queries are written using Apache Flinks Streaming API and its CEP library. 
We are currently cleaning up our code base and actively filling this repository with content. 

## Repository Structure
- Each class in the source folder presents a single pattern or query
- You can run each pattern by using the provided parameters on top of the class
- For each pattern, we provide a translated ASP query, e.g., Q1_SEQQuery is the translation of Q1_SEQPattern 
- All queries and patterns are listed in the PatternQueryCatalog.md

## Mapping

## Next Steps

We are currently investigating a solution with connectors to various ASP engines, e.g., Apache Flink, Spark, and Beam, to automatically transform a declarative pattern into an ASP query.  
Yet, the mapping needs to be applied manually. 

## Mapping Directives: How to apply the mapping to your pattern - An Example

We use the structure of the SQL-based language SASE+ [1,2] to specify example patterns. 
The SASE+ language uses the following general structure:

``` 
PATTERN < pattern structure >
[ WHERE < pattern matching condition >]
[ WITHIN < sliding window >]
[ RETURN < output specification >]
```

The **PATTERN** clause contains the operators and streams the pattern it is applied to. 
1. Each stream of the **PATTERN** clause is added to the **FROM** clause of the query (separated by `,` to form the Cartesian Product as default). 
2. The **WHERE** clauses of both requests are identical for simple threshold filters and inter-event constraints.
2. For each SEQ-pair, i.e., SEQ(A,B), create a predicate for increasing timestamp and combine predicates using a logical AND. Do the same for each event m of the iteration operator.

   **Note:** The sequence operator is associative and SEQ(A,B,C) is short for SEQ(SEQ(A,B),C)/SEQ(A,SEQ(B,C)). 
   
   For a negated event type (negation operator), add a negated EXISTS operator with the following sub-query in the **WHERE** clause and remove the negated event type from the **FROM** clause.
   ``` sql
   NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
               FROM Stream T2
              [WHERE <SEQ Time-Constraints>])
    ``` 
   **Note:** The **WHERE** clause of the sub-query is only required if the negation operator is nested in a sequence and depends on its position.
2. Identify join predicates in the WHERE clause, and for each identified join predicate, transform the Cartesian Product in the **FROM** clause (e.g., FROM stream a, stream b) into a join (e.g., FROM stream a JOIN stream b ON key_a = key_b). For performance benefits in a distributed system, prefer Equi joins over Theta Joins. 
3. The **WITHIN** clause contains the window constraint W of the pattern. In the query, the window constraint W defines the Range of the **WINDOW** clause (the window size).  
4. Finally, the **SELECT** clause defines the output specification of the query is defined
with âˆ—. 

   **Note:** The output tuple can also be modified in the pattern by adding the **RETURN** clause.
