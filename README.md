# Bridging the Gap: Complex Event Processing on Stream Processing Engines

This repository provides a query catalog of CEP patterns and their respective ASP queries, translated using our theoretical operator mapping approach. 
The provided queries are written using Apache Flinks Streaming API and its CEP library. 
We are currently cleaning up our code base and actively filling this repository with content. 

## Repository Structure
- Each class in the source folder presents a single pattern or query
- You can run each pattern by using the provided parameters on top of the class
- For each pattern, we provide a translated ASP query, e.g., Q1_SEQQuery is the translation of Q1_SEQPattern 
- All queries and patterns are listed in the PatternQueryCatalog.md
